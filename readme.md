# replicant-server

A Clojure library providing remote implementations of the Clojure data structures and a remote REPL server hosted over prepl.

This software is considered an alpha release and subject to change.

## Rationale

While the ability to connect to Clojure REPLs over a wire is a powerful lever for programmers, the transport of data over an active connection is problemmatic in numerous ways:

- Transport of large or deep collection is slow
- Transport of lazy sequences forces realization
- Not all objects are able to transport, some examples being:
  - Objects with types unavailble to both sides of the wire
  - Objects holding local resources (e.g. files, sockets, etc.)
  - Functions
- Not all objects are printable, and therefore unable to transport

Replicant works to alleviate the issues outlined above by providing the following capabilities:

- Replicant transports large collections by passing partial data over the wire. On the other side, Replicant constructs Remote Data Structures that act as Clojure data for read-only operations and request more data as needed
- Replicant transports only the head of lazy sequences and on the other side can fetch more data as needed
- Replicant handles objects that cannot transport by constructing remote references that may later serve as handles for evaluation when requested
- Replicant transports function references that allow remote invocation
- Replicant uses a Datafy context to allow extensibility in the way that objects print on the wire

To this end Replicant provides two libraries: [Replicant Server](https://github.com/clojure/data.alpha.replicant-server) (this library) and [Replicant Client](https://github.com/clojure/data.alpha.replicant-client).

# Release Information

Latest release:

[deps.edn](https://clojure.org/reference/deps_and_cli) dependency information:

The replicant-server library is intended for use as a git dep:

```clojure
io.github.clojure/data.alpha.replicant-server {:git/tag "v2023.05.02.01" :git/sha "947d8a8"}
``` 

## Usage

replicant-server is meant to run in-process. Once added as a dependency, the following will launch an embedded remote PREPL awaiting a [replicant-client](https://github.com/clojure/data.alpha.replicant-client) or socket connection.

```clojure
(require '[clojure.data.alpha.replicant.server.prepl :as replicant])
(replicant/start :host "hostname")
```

The function `start` takes a map of options allowing customized values for `:port` and `:name` parameters. By default the function runs as if the following was passed:

```clojure
(replicant/start {:host "hostname", :name "rds", :port 5555})
```

You can stop a named Replicant server using the `stop-replicant` function, passing the name given it at start time:

```clojure
(replicant/stop "rds")
```

Stopping an active Replicant server will close all clients connected to it and clear its remote data cache.
