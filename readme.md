# replicant-server

A Clojure a library providing remote implementations of the Clojure data structures and a remote REPL server hosted over prepl.

## Rationale

While the ability to connect to Clojure REPLs over a wire is a powerful lever for programmers, the transport of data-structures can bog down an active connection. Replicant works to avoid sending data over the wire until it's requested. "Large" data structures (via length or depth) are "remotified" - stored in a cache on the server, passed as a remote reference. When more data is needed, a call is made internally over the remote connection to retrieve more data.

# Release Information

Latest release:

[deps.edn](https://clojure.org/reference/deps_and_cli) dependency information:

As a git dep:

```clojure
io.github.clojure/replicant-server {:git/tag "vTODO" :git/sha "TODO"}
``` 

## Usage

replicant-server is meant to run in-process. Once added as a dependency, the following will launch an embedded remote PREPL awaiting a [replicant-client](https://github.com/clojure/replicant-client) or socket connection.

```clojure
(require '[clojure.data.alpha.replicant.server.prepl :as rs])
(rs/start-replicant)
```

The function `start-replicant` takes a map of options allowing customized values for `:address`, `:port`, and `:name` parameters.
